* togetherly.el

[[https://melpa.org/#/togetherly][file:https://melpa.org/packages/togetherly-badge.svg]]

allow multiple clients to edit a single buffer on-line

ネットワーク経由で同じバッファをわいわい編集

** Screencast

[[file:imgs/screencast.gif]]

** Usage

- As a server:

  1. Open a buffer you want to share.

  2. Call =M-x togetherly-server-start= and set IP address / port to
     listen to.

  3. Call =M-x togetherly-server-close= when finished.

  If you want to share another buffer with the same members, call =M-x
  togetherly-server-start= again in that buffer (without closing the
  server).

- As a client:

  1. Call =M-x togetherly-client-start= and input IP address / port
     you want to login to.

  2. Kill =*Togetherly*= buffer when finished.

** Limitations

- =togetherly.el= does not support multiple servers / client per a
  single Emacs instance (for now).

- =togetherly.el= is not secure at all (for now) so you should not
  share secret documents.

** Bug reporting

Before reporting "conenction error" bugs, PLEASE DO :

- confirm that the IP address is reachable (try =ping <addr>=)

- check that your firewall setting permits Emacs to use the port

- confirm that simpler servers work fine ([[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsEchoServer][EmacsEchoServer]] for example)
